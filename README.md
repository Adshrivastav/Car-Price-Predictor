# Car-Price-Predictor
**Overview**
The Car Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the prices of cars based on various features. This project utilizes a dataset containing information about different car models, including their specifications, features, and historical prices. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to provide insights into the factors that influence car prices and offer a reliable tool for potential buyers and sellers.

**Features**
Data Preprocessing: The project includes comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analyses are performed to understand the relationships between different features and car prices.
Machine Learning Models: Various regression algorithms are implemented, including:
Linear Regression: A simple model that assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: A boosting technique that builds models sequentially to minimize prediction errors.
XGBoost Regressor: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm that is efficient and effective for large datasets.
Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
Visualization: Data visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate key findings and model performance.
User Interface: The project includes a Gradio interface that allows users to input car features and receive price predictions in real-time.

**Technologies Used**
Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model development.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
XGBoost: For advanced gradient boosting techniques.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Joblib: For model serialization and saving.
Gradio: For creating an interactive user interface to serve the model.
